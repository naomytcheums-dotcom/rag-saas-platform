"""
Ingestion pipeline for the FastAPI documentation RAG assistant.

Reads every Markdown file under data/raw/, resolves FastAPI's custom
"{* path *}" code-snippet includes (which point to files outside the
markdown itself, under the sibling `fastapi/docs_src/` folder), strips
HTML/admonition markup, and writes a clean, structured JSON file to
data/processed/fastapi_docs.json for the next pipeline stage (chunking
and embedding).

# them against a fixed base, and empirically every single include in the
# docs (502/502) uses the literal "../../docs_src/..." prefix regardless of
# how deeply nested the .md file is. So we strip the leading "../" segments
# and resolve the remainder (always starting with "docs_src/") against the

# matters for ingestion, so everything up to the closing "*}" is
# consumed non-greedily and discarded.
#
# `\s+` (mandatory whitespace) after "{*" is deliberate: it's what tells a
# real include apart from Python dict-unpacking syntax like "{**old_dict,
# ...}" that shows up verbatim in the docs' prose/code -- that text starts
# with "{*" too but always has another "*" right after, never whitespace.
# The pattern is also deliberately confined to a single line (no DOTALL):
# a false match on "{*" would otherwise search for the next "*}" anywhere
# later in the file and swallow everything in between.
